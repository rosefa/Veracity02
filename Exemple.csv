1,"In Bakhmut, a relentless battle for the fortress of the absurd","07 Feb 2023 In Bakhmut, a relentless battle for the fortress of the absurd. Barsik , known by his nom de guerre, slumps on a stool. He is exhausted. We are holding the line, says the Ukrainian soldier with a slightly surprised smile, as if he had trouble believing it himself. On this front, on the edge of the two provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk in the Donbas, and north of the town of Bakhmut, the Russian offensive is extremely brutal. We have to hold the line for our brothers in arms, the comrades from the unit on our left and the comrades from the unit on our right, says Barsik. We have no choice. To back down would be to betray them, in a way, because they would become vulnerable. On the front line, a Russian tank attacks. One, two cannon shots. They shoot at the minefield hoping to open a corridor, then they launch the infantry, says Zakhar , the staff sergeant of the 518th battalion of the 1st special forces brigade named after Ivan Bohun, a 17th century Cossack fighter. Sure enough, automatic weapon fire follows immediately. The assault has begun. Drawn-looking with a scraggly beard, Barsik, also nicknamed Bazooka Man because he is a grenadier, listens to the sounds of battle, taking advantage of a brief moment of respite in the cellar of a house in a nearby village. The place serves as both an advanced medical post and an ammunition depot, between the first and second line of defense. - LEMONDE",LEMONDE,2/7/2023,idlib,0
2,Ukraine says Russians endure deadliest day so far as fighting intensifies in east,"07 Feb 2023 Ukraine says Russians endure deadliest day so far as fighting intensifies in east. NEAR MARYINKA, Ukraine, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Ukraine said on Tuesday the last 24 hours were the deadliest of the war so far for Russian troops as Moscow pressed on with an intensifying winter assault in the east, bringing tens of thousands of freshly mobilised troops to the battlefield. But the assertion that the fighting was the deadliest so far fits descriptions from both sides of an escalating campaign of close-contact trench warfare, which has left snow-covered battlefields of eastern Ukraine littered with corpses. Close to the town of Maryinka, some 30 km (18.6 miles) from the eastern city of Donetsk, a marine unit of Ukraine s armed forces fired rockets on Russian positions from a Soviet-era launch system. They storm in small infantry groups, trying to creep in further and further. Even without previous artillery strikes (on Ukrainian positions), their infantry attempts to move in, said a soldier who gave his name only as Ievhen. The enemy adapted quite well, they learn as fast as we do. They adopted different kinds of tactics, he added. Kyiv and the West say Russia has been pouring troops and mercenaries into eastern Ukraine in recent weeks in hopes of being able to claim new gains around the time of the first anniversary of its full-scale invasion later this month. A lieutenant in the Ukrainian unit who gave his name as Volodymyr said: The targets are given to us either by drone operators or by our spotters - they observe where our rockets explode. Then, we correct our fire direction and launch again. The Ukrainian military increased its running tally of Russian military dead by 1,030 overnight to 133,190, and described the increase as the highest of the war so far. For its part, Russia said it had inflicted 6,500 Ukrainian casualties in the month of January. The war is soon entering its second year at a pivotal juncture, with Moscow attempting to regain the initiative while Kyiv holds out for Western tanks to mount a counter-offensive later in 2023. After Russia failed to capture the Ukrainian capital Kyiv last year and lost ground in the second half of 2022, Moscow is now making full use of hundreds of thousands of troops it called up in its first mobilisation since World War Two. The last few weeks have seen Russia boast its first gains for half a year. But the progress has still been incremental, with Moscow yet to capture a single major population centre in its winter campaign despite thousands of dead. Fighting has focused for months around Ukrainian-held Bakhmut in eastern Donetsk province, a city with a pre-war population of around 75,000. Russia has made clear progress towards encircling it from both the north and south, but Kyiv says its garrison is holding fast. Moscow has also launched an assault further south against Vuhledar, a Ukrainian-controlled bastion also in Donetsk province on high ground at the strategic intersection between the eastern and southern front lines. NO WORD FROM ZELENSKIY ON DEFENCE MINISTER Since the New Year, Western countries have pledged hundreds of tanks and armoured vehicles to Ukraine to give it the firepower and mobility to push through Russian lines and recapture occupied territory later this year. A new U.S. package of weapons is expected to include longer-range rockets, which would give Ukraine the ability to hit Russian supply lines in all of the territory it occupies in Ukraine s mainland and parts of the Crimea peninsula. But it will take months before they arrive, and meanwhile Ukraine faces a Russian force with its manpower replenished by Moscow s call-up of reservists. The Kremlin says Western supplies of arms only widen and extend the conflict. The U.S. and its allies are trying to prolong the conflict as much as possible, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Tuesday in a conference call with military officials. To do this, they have started supplying heavy offensive weapons, openly urging Ukraine to seize our territories. In fact, such steps are dragging NATO countries into the conflict and could lead to an unpredictable level of escalation. His use of the phrase our territories appeared to refer to four Ukrainian provinces Russia claimed to have annexed last year, as well as Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. In a daily intelligence update, Britain s Defence Ministry said Russia s military had been trying since early January to restart major offensive operations to capture Ukraine-held parts of Donetsk region, but had gained little ground so far. The Russians lack munitions and manoeuvre units required for a successful offensive , it said. Ukrainian officials say Moscow could be accumulating weapons and reserves for an even bigger push in coming weeks. The Ukrainian governor of Luhansk province predicted a big Russian offensive there that could begin around Feb. 15. The past few weeks meanwhile have seen a purge of Ukrainian officials in an anti-corruption campaign, the first big shake-up of Ukraine s leadership since the war began. In his Monday evening address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said personnel changes on the border and front line would bolster Ukraine s military efforts. But he gave no indication about the fate of his defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov. The head of a parliamentary faction of Zelenskiy s party had said on Sunday that Reznikov would be replaced, but said on Monday no changes would be made this week. - REUTER",REUTER,2/7/2023,idlib,0
3,Ukrainian forces continue to push back the Russians,"07 Feb 2023 Ukrainian forces continue to push back the Russians. In the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war, Ukraine s Kharkiv counter-offensive continued to push back the Russian military. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy claims Ukrainian forces have taken back 6,000 square kilometers (2,400 square miles) of Ukrainian territory. The U.S. said many Russian soldiers have left Ukraine, as Russia admitted that the front had been broken. While it has been confirmed that over 1,000 people have died, the true figure could be much higher. The Kremlin has refused peace negotiations and stated that Russia will continue to achieve their goals in the special military operation. Ukrainian forces continued advancing, and, on 13 September, took back Vovchansk, according to Ukraine s border guard services. While not verified, the pre-occupation mayor of Melitopol has said Russian troops had begun to withdraw. Reportedly, if Melitopol is captured, the Ukrainians could disrupt the supply line in the east Donbas region. In the recently recaptured village of Chkalovske, a citizen, Svitlana Honchar, talked about the Russians fleeing: They left like the wind. They were fleeing by any means they could. However, some were left behind, as she adds, They were trying to catch up. President Zelenskyy also promised a return to normalcy for the recent areas that were re-captured. Ukrainian Deputy Minister of Defense Hanna Maliar said, Ukraine was trying to get Russian troops to surrender. Ahead of their advance, they threw flyers saying, Russians use you as cannon fodder. Your life doesn’t mean anything for them. You don’t need this war. Surrender to Armed Forces of Ukraine. Ukrainian officials were also investigating the liberated areas to discover any atrocities and assess alleged war crimes committed by the Russians. In the city of Balakliya, local officials reported that the Russians set up a torture chamber at the local police station. Allegedly, Russian forces always kept at least 40 people captive in the area. Nationalism in Ukraine remained strong, as the government released videos of burning Russian flags and the charred tanks left behind. They shot a video of Ukrainians ripping a sign that said, We are one people with Russia. Other things which were found left behind in liberated territories include purposely damaged weapons and vehicles, especially abandoned tanks. On 25 September, President Zelenskyy released a statement saying the Kharkiv fighting had been fierce, but Ukrainian forces continue to succeed. This is the Donetsk region, this is our Kharkiv region. This is the Kherson region, and also the Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia regions, Zelenskyy said. Ukraine also secured many bridges around the Oskil river, located in Kharkiv. The southern area of Ukraine also has heavy fighting, as the Ukrainians hope to re-capture a Russian controlled town. In Russia, the war began to be criticized. Vladimir Putin certified an act which calls for 300,000 Russian reservists, which was met with many huge protests and criticism from top lawmakers in the country. In response, Zelenskyy called the Russo-Ukrainian war a war that one man wants . Russia has also released a new referendum saying they will annex four Ukrainian territories they have invaded, causing fear in Ukraine. Ukrainian allies, including the United States, remained hesitant to declare victory, as Russia still had considerable forces in the area including many missiles and dangerous weapons. The Russians continued to inflict heavy damage, shelling Lozova, which killed three and injured nine. Shelling has also continued in Kharkiv. Biggest of all, the act that calls for 300,000 Russian reserves. For now, however, the Ukrainians seemed to be continuing their push into Russian-occupied Ukraine. - WIKINEWS",WIKINEWS,2/7/2023,idlib,0
4,Ukraine s Zelenskyy accuses Russia of war crimes in address to UN,"Thursday 7 April 2022 Ukraine s Zelenskyy accuses Russia of war crimes in address to UN. On Tuesday, Ukraine s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of committing war crimes against civilians during the ongoing invasion via live video feed to the United Nations Security Council. Zelenskyy said: The Russian military searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our country. They shot and killed women outside their houses when they just tried to call someone who is alive. They killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies. Demanding the perpetrators and their superiors be brought before a war crimes tribunal and held accountable, he specified: They cut off limbs, cut their throats. Women were raped and killed in front of their children. Russian ambassador to the UN Vasily Nebenzya repeated that the Government of Russia denies the allegations. He asserted that video footage was a crude forgery arranged by Ukraine. You only saw what they showed you. The only ones who would fall for this are Western dilettantes, he said. Ukraine said it found hundreds of dead bodies, notably in Bucha, after forces reclaimed areas outside capital city Kyiv. Iryna Venediktova, the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, said on Sunday that 410 bodies were found in areas around Kyiv, telling Reuters: We need to work with witnesses to assess the extent of the crimes. People today are so stressed that they are physically unable to speak, she said. On Sunday, Zelenskyy accused Russia of seeking: The elimination of the whole nation, and the people. We are the citizens of Ukraine. Asked if it was genocide on CBS program Face the Nation, Zelenskyy said: Indeed. This is genocide. Ukraine released images depicting people shot in the back of the head, many with their hands tied behind their backs. The Russian Ministry of Defence issued a statement on Monday reading: During the time that [Bucha] has been under the control of the Russian armed forces, not a single local resident has suffered from any violent action. Russian servicemen have delivered and distributed 452 tonnes of humanitarian aid to civilians in [the] Kyiv Region. The statement claimed photographs were a hoax and provocations of Ukrainian radicals. Satellite photography over Bucha from Maxar Technologies appeared to show dead bodies in the same positions for weeks, as well as a mass grave at the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints. According to CNN, people were hoping to find their relatives in the grave which may contain upwards of a 150 people. Nevertheless, Russia s Director of the Information Maria Zakharova, denied the legitimacy of footage from Bucha. Who are the masters of provocation? Of course the United States and NATO, she said, saying the outrage was a planned attempt to tarnish Russia s reputation. International responses were issued earlier this week despite Russia s stance. United Kingdom foreign minister Liz Truss said: Britain has helped lead the way with sanctions to cripple the Putin war machine. We will do more to ramp up the pressure on Russia and we will keep pushing others to do more . US Secretary of State Antony Blinken joined: We’re tightening the existing sanctions. We’re adding new ones. We’re doing it in full coordination with Europeans and other partners around the world. And one of the results is that the Russian economy is reeling. You can expect further sanctions announcements this week. And we are coordinating with our allies and partners on what the exact parameters of that will be, added US security advisor Jake Sullivan. - WIKINEWS",WIKINEWS,5/7/2022,idlib,0
